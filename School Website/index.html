                <h1> Humble Beginnings </h1>
                <p> The Don Honorio Ventura Technological State University (DHVTSU) started when an Augustinian friar, Fr. Juan P. Zita, dreamed of helping young lads of Bacolor. Aided by equally benevolent civic leader Don Felino Gil, the school was officially founded on November 4, 1861 upon the approval of its statues by Governor-General Lemery as “Escuela de Artes y Oficios de Bacolor” and built it on a lot donated by Suarez sisters of Bacolor. </p>
                <p> From the date of its founding to the present, the school was burned five times. The first of unknown origin, was in April, 1869 and it was reconstructed in 1892 but was burned again for the second time in 1896 when the school was used as quarters and barracks of the “Voluntarios Locales de Bacolor” (native soldiers under the Spanish Army) who were the first to revolt against the Spain. The third fire caused by the explosions of shells occurred in 1898. The school then was made as Maestranza (ordinance in the manufacture of bullets and cannon balls) by the Amobilizadores (native soldiers of Spanish Government). The fourth fire occurred during Japanese Occupation from 1941 to 1944 when the Japanese occupied the school and burned it in the course of their retreat from the American Forces of Liberation in December 1944. It was rebuilt again with the aid of the American people under the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946 only to be burned once more on July 7, 1958 when the school was already serving as a regional school of arts and trades.</p>
